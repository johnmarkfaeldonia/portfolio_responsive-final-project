                <h3>web design</h3>
                <p>I think web design is becoming more applicable to me because as a photo editor and graphic designer, I can only think of ways to make the website beautiful and visually pleasing to others.</p>

                <h3>graphic design</h3>
                <p>With the grace of God, in my district, I am the one responsible for determining what makes good graphic design and I am fortunate to see my own improvement as a graphic designer over the past year.</p>

                <h3>photo editor</h3>
                <p>Taking pictures has been my favorite hobby since I was a child and continues to be so today. When my district needs a camera operator, I am the one they call, and my role includes being responsible for one of the multimedia tasks, operating the camera.</p>

                <p>In our local, I have been assigned to create documentation for the MCGI Cares Pantry, and by the grace of God, it was executed properly and I fulfilled my duty well.</p>

                <h3>Good communicating</h3>
                <p>Good communication is one of my strengths; this skill gives me the opportunity to take risks, and even when it may not be possible for others, I am able to socialize with strangers and talk to them as if they were friends.</p>

                <h3>Good Time Management</h3>
                <p>Time management is one of my favorite things because it gives me a challenge and helps me to lead a disciplined life, in order to become a better person. I believe that time is precious, and cannot be regained once it has passed.</p>
